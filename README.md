### Links
- Live Site URL: [https://fm-qr-code-component-main.netlify.app/]

## My process
- Structure:
outermost container
  | top container
    | div
      | qr code image

  |_bottom container
    | h2 - bold font. should've used h1
    | span - holds the bottom text with less opacity

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop only workflow

### What I learned

1. Practiced setting structure for containers.
2. Identifying patterns to see which themes (or components) are re-used.
3. Learned about font families, and opacity

### Continued development

1. Struggled with applying dynamic positioning. Need to know more flexbox properties. 
2. Need to know relative sizing and positioning.

### Useful resources

- [https://blog.hubspot.com/website/opacity-css] - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Opacity. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
